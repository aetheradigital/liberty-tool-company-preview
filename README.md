# Liberty Tool Company — Client Preview Portal

Static preview of libertytoolcompany.com and the launch materials, for client review only (pages are `noindex`).

- `/` — Preview portal (start here)
- `/option-1/` — Homepage, Option 1 (Classic)
- `/option-2/` — Homepage, Option 2 (Fun / Logo Blue)
- `/approvals/` — Social Approval Board (Nov 2 – Dec 1, 26 posts). Decisions save in the reviewer's browser (localStorage).
- `/ads/` — Ad creative (5 feed ads)

Plain HTML, no build step. `public/runtime.js` renders each page's template and runs the interactive pieces. Forms, booking, Quote List and checkout are front-end only until wired to HighLevel and Shopify.

Deploy: Render static site, publish directory `public`.
